The three-body Lennard-Jones system on the plane has a transition state, which is the straight conformation
located at a saddle point of the potential-energy landscape. We show that the transition state can be dynamically
stabilized by excited vibration of particle distances. The stabilization mechanism is explained theoretically and
is verified by performing molecular dynamics simulations. We also examine whether the dynamical stabilization
gives an impact on the reaction rate between the two isomers of equilateral triangle conformations by comparing
with the transition-state theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

The state is said to be unstable if the potential energy
landscape takes a saddle or a local maximum at the corresponding state. A typical example is the inverted pendulum
under the gravity. However, dynamics may change stability,
and the inverted pendulum is stabilized by applying fast small
oscillation of the pivot in the vertical direction. This pendulum
is known as the Kapitza pendulum [1–4]. The essence of this
dynamical stabilization is existence of multiple scales in time
and space: The averaged fast small motion gives an additional
term to the potential energy landscape, and the effective potential for slow motion may have a local minimum at the
inverted position. Interestingly, the vertical motion of the pivot
contributes to the stabilization in the orthogonal rotational
direction.
The Kapitza pendulum is a nonautonomous system, but
dynamical stabilization has been generalized to autonomous
Hamiltonian systems [5,6]. Consider a chainlike model consisting of three beads and two springs, where two nearby
beads are connected by a spring [7]. Comparing with the
Kapitza pendulum, the two springs play the role of the
oscillating pivot, and the angle between the two springs corresponds to the pendulum angle. Focusing on the angle motion,
we can reduce the full system to a one-degree-of-freedom
system, and the reduced part provides an additional potential,
which may change the stability ruled by the bare potential
energy landscape. This phenomenon is named by the dynamically induced conformation (DIC). It might be worth
mentioning that vibration in the radial direction stabilizes the
orthogonal rotational direction as the Kapitza pendulum.
DIC is firstly observed in numerical simulations of chainlike bead-spring systems [8], and is explained theoretically
in three-body system [5] and later in N-body systems [6] by
using the multiple-scale analysis [9] and the averaging method
[10–12]. A remarkable difference of DIC from the Kapitza

pendulum is that the stabilization depends on excited modes
of the vibration: The mode having the lowest eigenfrequency
contributes to the stabilization, and contribution to the destabilization emerges by exciting higher eigenfrequency modes
[5,6].
The previous studies on DIC have two restrictions: (i) the
system should be chainlike and (ii) the bending potential
which determines conformation is separately introduced in
addition to the spring potential. Due to these restrictions, a
system is out of range which has pairwise potentials but has no
explicit bending potential, although such a system is important
to study. For instance, the Lennard-Jones potential [13–15] is
frequently used to model the intermolecular interaction.
In this article, we consider the three-body Lennard-Jones
system on the plane, which is not a chainlike model but a
ringlike model. The system has two minima, each of which
corresponds to an equilateral triangle. Let the beads be named
by A, B, and C. One triangle is ABC and the other is ACB.
Due to two-dimensionality, between the two minima, there
exists a transition state at which conformation is straight. The
transition state is located at a saddle point of the potential
energy landscape, but stabilization of the transition state is
numerically observed and phenomenologically analyzed [16].
One of the aims of this article is to give a systematic explanation to the numerically observed stabilization by resulting in
DIC. The other aim is to examine if DIC modifies the reaction
rate, which is predicted by the transition state theory (TST)
[17–24].
The three-body Lennard-Jones system on the plane is a
simple model of isomerization, and it is a first step to deeply
understand dynamical effects of isomerization in complex
molecules. For example, excited mode dependence of isomer
population has been examined experimentally [25,26]. Further, related dynamical effects have been observed in atomic
clusters by considering the internal coordinates [27–30].
This paper is organized as follows. The three-body
Lennard-Jones system is introduced and the potential energy
landscape is analyzed in Sec. II. We show in Sec. III that the
essence of DIC, separation of temporal and spatial scales, is

Dynamically induced stability is studied in Sec. IV, and is
examined in numerical simulations in Sec. V. The reaction
rate is reported in Sec. VI. The last section VII is devoted to
summary.
II. MODEL

We consider the three-body Lennard-Jones system on R2 .
The system is described by the Lagrangian
1
m||r˙i ||2 − V (r),
2 i=1
3

L(r, ṙ) =

(1)

where ri ∈ R2 is the position of the ith mass, ṙi = dri /dt, || · ||
is the Euclidean norm, t is the time, and r = (r1 , r2 , r3 ). We
assume that the three masses are identical. The total potential
energy V consists of pairwise interactions as
V (r) = ULJ (l1 ) + ULJ (l2 ) + ULJ (l3 ),

(2)

FIG. 2. Lennard-Jones potential (purple solid line). The lengths
at a straight conformation are l1 = l2 = l ‡ and l3 = 2l ‡ , which are
marked by the vertical black lines. The green broken curve represents
the harmonic approximation around the bottom point.

We reduce the translational symmetry by introducing the
internal coordinates y = (y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 ) = (l1 , l2 , φ, φL ). The
angle φ is the bending angle between r2 − r1 and r3 − r2 .
For instance, φ = 0 represents a straight conformation (see
Fig. 1). The last angle variable φL is associated with the total
angular momentum, which is another integral of the system.
The length l3 is written as a function of (l1 , l2 , φ) as
l32 = l12 + l22 + 2l1 l2 cos φ.

(7)

The total potential energy V is read as
V (y) = ULJ (l1 ) + ULJ (l2 ) + ULJ

where
l1 = ||r1 − r2 ||,

l2 = ||r2 − r3 ||,

l3 = ||r3 − r1 ||.

A. Internal coordinates

The system has the translational symmetry and the rotational symmetry. The associated integrals are the total
momentum vector and the total angular momentum. We set
them as zero.

where Bαβ (y) is the (α, β ) element of the matrix B(y). See
Appendix A for the explicit expression of B(y). The variable
φL is not crucial since it is a cyclic coordinate associated with
the rotational symmetry. Hereafter, we omit the angle φL , and
use the same symbol y for y = (y1 , y2 , y3 ) = (l1 , l2 , φ).
B. Stationary points of V

The potential V has two minima and three saddle points.
The two minima are located at (l1 , l2 , φ) = (lmin , lmin , 2π /3)
and (lmin , lmin , −2π /3), which correspond to the equilateral
triangle and the inverse equilateral triangle conformations.
Between the two minima, there exists a saddle at y‡ =
(l ‡ , l ‡ , 0), which represents a straight conformation and which
we focus on. We omit two other saddles (straight conformations) since they are obtained by changing the order of masses.
The length l ‡ satisfies the stationarity condition

III. MULTISCALE ANALYSIS

The essential mechanism of DIC is separation of temporal
and spatial scales. In the previous studies [5,6], to realize
slow bending motion of φ, the total potential is composed
of the spring potential Vspring (l1 , l2 ) and the bending potential
 2Vbend (φ), where  is a small dimensionless parameter  (0 <
  1). We demonstrate that the three-body Lennard-Jones
system induces, intrinsically, the separation of scales and a
bending potential of O( 2 ) around the transition state y‡ .

B. Spatial scale and potential forces

For the dependent variables, we are interested in a region
close to the transition state y‡ and, from Fig. 3, we expand
them as

i = 1, 2

φ(t0 , t1 ) = φ (t1 ) + φ (t0 , t1 ),

A. Separation of timescales

We estimate the timescales around the transition state y‡
by considering the linearized equations of motion. The Taylor
expansion of the total potential V around y‡ gives
∇V (y) = HV (y‡ )(y − y‡ ) + · · · ,

The expansions (18), (19), and (22) are the same as ones
used in the previous analyses [5,6], whereas the three-body
Lennard-Jones system does not satisfy the two restrictions
mentioned in Sec. I. Therefore, DIC should be reproduced
around the transition state y‡ .
Let us revisit the origin of the above expansions. The two
timescales and (∂V/∂φ)(1) = 0 are induced from smallness of
the ratio (17). Thus, we may expect emergence of DIC in
other systems apart from the Lennard-Jones potential, if the
pairwise potential U has a steep well [i.e. large U  (l ‡ )] and
a gradual tail [i.e. small U  (2l ‡ )/(2l ‡ )]. A harmonic potential U (l ) = k(l − σ )2 /2 is out of this scope, since U  (l ‡ ) =
U  (2l ‡ ) = k and U  (2l ‡ )/(2l ‡ ) = k/4 are of the same order,
where the stationary length l ‡ satisfying Eq. (10) is l ‡ =
2σ /3.
IV. DYNAMICAL STABILITY OF THE TRANSITION STATE

Along computations performed in [5,6], we can reduce the
three-dimensional dynamical system of (l1 , l2 , φ) to the onedimensional dynamical system of φ (0) (t1 ), which appears in
O( 2 ). We sketch the derivation. See Appendix B for details.
In O(), we have linear equations of motion for fast motion
of l1(1) and l2(1) . The two lengths l1 and l2 extend and contract
simultaneously in the in-phase mode (mode-I) and alternatively in the antiphase mode (mode-II). If we modify l1 and
l2 initially from the equilibrium value l ‡ as
(i = 1, 2),

(24)

energy EII are

(26)

We remark that the potential force ∂V/∂φ in Eq. (26) is of
O( 2 ) from Eqs. (22) and (23), and Enormal = EI + EII is also
of O( 2 ) from (25). The function T (φ (0) ) is defined by

(23)

The asterisk parts are not important in the later discussions
and we neglect them. The bending potential depending on φ
appears from O( 2 ) without any artificial scalings. The two
scales of ∇V can be understood graphically in Fig. 3 with the
fact V (y) − V (y‡ ) = O( 2 ) around y‡ .

li = l ‡ + δli ,

We hypothesize that the ratio between the two normal-mode
energy EI and EII is constant in time [5,6], and introduce νI :
νII = EI : EII with νI + νII = 1.
The equation of motion for φ (0) (t1 ) is obtained in O( 2 ),
which includes the fast motion of l1(1) (t0 , t1 ) and l2(1) (t0 , t1 ).
Performing the averaging over the fast timescale t0 , we can
eliminate the initial phases of the two normal modes, but
cannot eliminate the energy ratios, νI and νII . This is the origin
of the excited mode dependence in DIC.
The above-mentioned averaging induces an extra force to
φ (0) (t1 ) in addition to the potential gradient. The effective
force Feff of O( 0 ) to the slow motion of φ (0) (t1 ) is expressed
as

Examples of the effective potential Veff are shown in Fig. 4.
The in-phase mode stabilizes the straight conformation φ =
0, while the antiphase mode enhances instability. This mode
dependence is the same as the chainlike model [5,6]. The bare
potential V is of O( 0 ) and Enormal is of O( 2 ), the additional
potential function is visible however for |δi |/σ ≃ 0.05, since

and Enormal /LJ is around 0.15.
We remark an important modification from the previous
work [5]. In the previous work, the normal mode energy
Enormal is eliminated in the effective potential Veff (φ) by using the total energy conservation, which includes energy of
φ (0) motion. The total energy conservation provides a global
effective potential under the hypothesis that the ratio νI : νII
is constant of time globally. In other words, the obtained
effective potential is valid for any value of φ. The constant
ratio hypothesis is not bad in a chainlike model, but it is not
good in the three-body Lennard-Jones system if φ is far from
0, because thermalization occurs easily (see Sec. V D for a
numerical test and Sec. VI for a success of a statistical theory). Therefore, we concentrate on a neighborhood of φ = 0
in which the hypothesis should be valid, and the effective
potential (28) is valid only around φ = 0.

V. MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS

We examine the theoretical stability S > 0 [see Eq. (32)]
by comparing it with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
We set m = 1, σ = 1, and LJ = 1 without loss of generality
by rescaling the time t and space ri in the equations of motion
(5), although we keep the symbols to clarify the source. MD
simulations are performed by using the 4th order symplectic
integrator [31] with the timestep t = 10−3 to keep the symplectic structure and to realize high precision.
A. Initial condition

The initial velocities of particles are zero, ṙi = 0 (i =
1, 2, 3), and the initial momenta are zero accordingly. The

First, we observe temporal evolution of l3 /l ‡ , shown in
Fig. 5. The quantity l3 /l ‡ is close to 2 if the system stays
around the straight conformation (a transition state), and is
close to 1 if the system is around an equilateral triangle
conformation (a minimum). In other words, l3 /l ‡ ≃ 2 implies
stabilization of the transition state, and l3 /l ‡ ≃ 1 implies nonstabilization.
The initial excitation of the normal modes is controlled
by the signs of δli : EI > EII if the signs are the same, and
EI < EII if the signs are opposite. In Figs. 5(a) and 5(d),
the antiphase mode (mode-II) is dominant as EI /EII = 1/9,
and the straight conformation is not stabilized. However, in
Figs. 5(b) and 5(c), the in-phase mode (mode-I) is dominant
as EI /EII = 9, and the straight conformation is stabilized up
to t ≃ 600 at least. Temporal evolution of l3 /l ‡ is consistent
with the effective potential shown in Fig. 4. To clarify a qualitative difference of dynamics between a nonstabilized saddle
and a stabilized one, power spectra of l1 (t ) are reported in
Appendix C.
Asymmetry between Figs. 5(b) and 5(c) is explained as
follows. The Lennard-Jones potential has a steeper wall in

in Fig. 6(c). Numerical observation is almost in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. The in-phase (antiphase)
mode axis runs from the left-lower (right-lower) corner to
the right-upper (left-upper) corner. Excitation of the in-phase
mode stabilizes the straight conformation if the excitation is
sufficiently strong, as we have observed in previous works
[5,6].
Slight discrepancies between numerical observation and
the theoretical prediction observed along the in-phase mode

axis in particular is again explained by asymmetry of the
Lennard-Jones potential in the contracting and extending directions. Indeed, the total energy is asymmetric [see Fig. 6(d)].
Enormal is underestimated in the contracting direction, while
it is overestimated in the extending direction. The theoretical
underestimation (overestimation) induces that numerical simulations gain (lose) stability around the boundary of stability.
The same analysis is performed in Fig. 7 for a wider range
of δl1 and δl2 . A larger |δli | gives a large value of the total
energy and induces frequent evaporation. Nevertheless, DIC
emerges in a upper-right region in particular. Validity of the
expansion, Eq. (19a), is no longer guaranteed in such a wider
range, but stabilization of the transition state is captured in a
short time regime except for the evaporation.
D. Test of hypothesis

We close this section by performing a numerical test of
the hypothesis: The ratio νI : νII is constant of time. The
initial condition is (δl1 , δl2 ) = (−0.07, −0.08), which gives
stability of the transition state only in a short term (see Fig. 6).
The expressions of EI and EII [see Eqs. (B19) and (B20)]
are derived by the harmonic approximation, but this approximation is not excellent if |δl1 | and |δl2 | are large (see Fig. 2).

away from the transition state. We hence conclude that the
hypothesis is valid while stabilization of the transition state is
realized.
VI. REACTION RATE

The transition state can be stabilized by the fast motion
of l1 and l2 . The next question is whether the stabilization
changes the reaction rate statistically. To answer this question,
we compute the reaction rate by TST and MD simulations.
The reaction rate is defined as the decrease in reactant (the
increase in product) per unit time.
TST is a theory to explain the reaction rate by using statistical mechanics. The idea of TST is as follows. We introduce
a dividing surface that divides the reactant and the product
in the phase space. Then, we compute the ratio between two
phase volumes: the volume which passes the dividing surface
within the unit time, and the phase volume of the reactant.
A more precise explanation is as follows. Let the three
bodies be A, B, and C. In our setting, the reactant is, for
instance, the triangle ABC, and the product is the triangle
ACB. Let us denote the Hamiltonian of the system by H (y, p).
TST gives an expression of the reaction rate k(E ) for total
energy E by

3 φ̇>0 δ(E − H (y, p))δ(φ)φ̇dyd p

k(E ) =
.
(38)
1
δ(E − H (y, p))dyd p
2
For the reaction route which passes the transition state y‡ =
(l ‡ , l ‡ , 0), we may set the dividing surface as φ = 0, and
the numerator represents the flux passing the dividing surface in the unit time from one side to the other. The factor
3 counts the three routes of isomerization associated with
the three transition states. The denominator is the half of the
phase space volume for total energy E , which corresponds to
the phase space volume of the reactant by symmetry. Concrete
expressions of H (y, p), momenta p = (p1 , p2 , p3 ), and φ̇ are
reported in Appendix D. Recall that the total angular momentum is set as zero.

VII. SUMMARY

FIG. 9. Reaction rate k(E ) as a function of E /LJ , where E is
the total energy. The lines represent the transition state theory with
P = 2 (purple broken) and P = 3 (green solid). Points are from direct
molecular dynamics simulations with T = 104 (blue crosses) and
T = 105 (orange circles). The vertical line marks the total potential
energy at the transition state, V (y‡ )/LJ ≃ −2.03.

To compute k(E ) of Eq. (38) numerically, we truncate
the phase space as l1 , l2 ∈ [0.8, 3], φ = [0, 2π ), p1 , p2 , p3 ∈
[−P, P]. We examine P = 2 and P = 3 to confirm that P = 3
is sufficiently large. On each truncated axis 100 points are
equally distributed, and the value of H (y, p) and the weight
φ̇ are computed totally at 1012 points. Finally, we make a
histogram with respect to E by dividing the interval E ∈
[−3, −1] into 100 bins, where the representative point of
the ith bin is Ei = −3 + 2(i + 0.5)/100 (i = 0, . . . , 99). We
neglected E > −1 since a particle may evaporate.
The reaction rate k(E ) is also computed by following the
definition and performing direct MD simulations. The initial
condition is the one introduced in Sec. V A with the constraint
δl2 = −δl1 to make the transition state unstable. The total
energy E depends on δl1 . The reaction rate k(E ) is obtained
as k(E ) = N (E , T )/T , where N (E , T ) is the number of isomerization during the time interval t ∈ [0, T ], and we set the
computing time T as T = 104 and T = 105 . We remark that
this reaction rate counts isomerizations from ABC to ACB
and from ACB to ABC, while Eq. (38) considers only from
ABC to ACB. We can define a corresponding reaction rate in
dynamics by discarding the periods in which the system is in
the well of ACB. However, this modification reduces T and
N (E , T ) by half from symmetry, and we keep all the periods
to enrich statistics.
The reaction rate k(E ) is reported in Fig. 9. First, we
confirm that P = 3 is sufficiently large for obtaining the theoretical precision, since the line with P = 3 collapses on the
line with P = 2. Second, by a similar reason, T = 105 is
sufficiently large for obtaining the reaction rate by MD simulations. Therefore, we conclude that the theoretical prediction
slightly underestimates the dynamical result for −1.6  E <
−1. However, the theoretical prediction is not far from MD,
and the dynamical stabilization does not strongly affect the
reaction rate in the three-body Lennard-Jones system irrespective of emergence of dynamical (de)stabilization.

Dynamically induced conformation (DIC) is a stabilization
mechanism of an unstable conformation with respect to a bare
potential energy landscape, and it is an analogy of the Kapitza
pendulum in autonomous systems. DIC has been previously
studied in chainlike bead-spring models with an artificially
induced weak bending potential function [5,6]. This article
demonstrated that in the three-body Lennard-Jones potential,
the transition state (a straight conformation) is also dynamically stabilized, although the system is neither a chainlike
system nor introducing any artificial potential. DIC in the
three-body Lennard-Jones system is based on the fact that
the potential has a steep well and a gradual tail, and we may
expect emergence of DIC in a similar system, while a system
with a harmonic pairwise potential is out of the range of the
present theory.
We can derive an effective potential, which is the sum
of the bare potential and the dynamical effect in the direction of conformation change. The steep well provides a large
prefactor in the dynamically induced term, and it becomes
comparable with instability strength of the bare potential.
However, the dynamical stabilization depends on the excited
mode: the in-phase mode contributes to stabilize the transition
state, while the antiphase mode contributes to enhance the
instability, as shown in the previous studies [5,6].
To answer whether the dynamical (de)stabilization has a
statistical impact, we compared the reaction rate computed
from the transition state theory and from direct MD simulations. The impact of dynamical (de)stabilization is not
remarkable. A possible explanation is coexistence of stabilization and destabilization depending on the normal mode
energy, which may be thermalized when the system visits a
well. Nevertheless, it might be interesting to study whether the
small discrepancy between the theory and MD is physically
meaningful.
Dynamics of the three-body Lennard-Jones system is considered as the isolated system in this article. It is worth
studying DIC with thermal noises, since they are not avoidable
in a real system. The essence of DIC is separation of scales in
time and space, and, hence, we may expect emergence of DIC
even under thermal noises. Another extension of the present
theory is a control of molecules by applying an external force
and by using the effective local minimum around the transition
state. Such a study may give a hint to solve the excited mode
dependence of isomer population [25,26].

APPENDIX C: POWER SPECTRA OF l1 (t )

We report in Fig. 10 power spectra of l1 (t ), which correspond to the time series of Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). We select l1 (t )
instead of l3 (t ), since l3 is almost dominated by the in-phase
mode around a straight conformation. We pick up a period
of 218 t, where t = 10−3 is the timestep of molecular dynamics. A nonstabilized saddle experiences chaotic dynamics
by visiting bottoms of potential landscape, and the power
spectrum is broad [Fig. 10(a)]. Around a stabilized saddle,
the power spectrum has sharp peaks and motion is regular
[Fig. 10(b)].
The above difference is also observed in two time regions
of the orbit shown in Fig. 5(c); The saddle point keeps (loses)
stability in the time region t < 600 (t > 650). In each of the
time regions, we pick up a time sequence of l1 (t ) in a period
of 218 t. The power spectrum in the stabilized time region is
reported in Fig. 11(a), and it has peaks as Fig. 10(b), although
the peaks are shifted and fade due to stronger nonlinear effects. After losing the stability, the power spectrum reported
in Fig. 11(b) is broad as Fig. 10(a).
